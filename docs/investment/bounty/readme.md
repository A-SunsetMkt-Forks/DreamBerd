## Rules

1. Evidence is required.
2. No tech bro charities.
3. First come first served. Once a bounty is completed, it can't be completed by anyone else.
4. Don't be weird about it. It's just a bit of fun.
5. Judging may be lenient in the case of near misses, but all judgements are down to my opinion etc.
